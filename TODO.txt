- Get a google maps API key owned by PWILD, not whoever used to own PMAPS
    "Usage costs are tracked by Project and are charged to the linked Cloud Billing account.

    Google Cloud or Google Maps Platform services. This is true even if you only use services
    that are free."

    - VISA gift card??

- Add comment feature on client
    - is the 'markers' variable necessary? Probably convenient for this but not sure otherwise
    - add database rule to allow appends to comments array
- Better colors for points
- Write documentation for future users
- Set up PMAPS email to forward to the PWILD duke email, document this
- Allow backup creation client side
- Sanitize inputs?
- Add password protection

Non-priority
- Filter by date
- Trails display
- Pictures?
- Styling archived points differently? Could do easily in the setStyle function where we style the other points
- Data validation for new points added - not really necessary
- Automatic backups sent to Git?? Non-priority stretch goal. If do this, make sure it doesn't spam the email


Done
- Show category in infowindow
- Legend for point colors (or different symbols)
- Store previous points with unique keys, instead of incrementing counter
- Add archive/unarchive feature on client
    - fix styling: both the legend and the toggle archived display should set a feature property
        that is checked in the main setStyle function.
    - all the markers should be in the markerLayer at all times
    - change in: legend checkbox onchange handler, legend archive button, info window toggle archived button
        - the info window toggle archived button shouldn't do any setProperty stuff; that should be in onChildChanged
    - how to handle new points though? (what values for these properties?)
        - archived_visible = global archived_visible var
        - my_category_visible = true, even if not really. Good for people to get confirmation their point was added
- Set (and test) database rules:
    - New "archived" attribute for all data points, this is the only thing updateable
    - No deletion allowed
