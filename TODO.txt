Priority
- Instructions window
    - mention that custom categories are allowed
    - mention how archiving works
    - mention comment deletion, distinction with archiving (can't undo, but backup still stored)
- Get a google maps API key owned by PWILD, not whoever used to own PMAPS
    "Usage costs are tracked by Project and are charged to the linked Cloud Billing account.

    - VISA gift card??
- Write documentation for future users
- Set up PMAPS email to forward to the PWILD duke email, document this
- Better dynamic HTML
    - Sanitize outputs with textContent
    - Consider changing the data input info window to use a div + innerHTML like we did for the data info window
        - do an event listener on the overall content div just like we did w the data input window
        - use a for loop for the datalist options
        - don't need to clear the input every time we open it, or have awkward HTML at the top of index.html
- Add password protection
- Remove need for JS detect mobile
- Option to download all data, unarchived data, archived data (dialog modal)


Non-priority
- Filter by date
- Trails display
- Pictures?
- Data validation for new points added - not really necessary
- Automatic backups sent to Git?? Non-priority stretch goal. If do this, make sure it doesn't spam the email

Done
- Show category in infowindow
- Legend for point colors (or different symbols)
- Store previous points with unique keys, instead of incrementing counter
- Add archive/unarchive feature on client
    - fix styling: both the legend and the toggle archived display should set a feature property
        that is checked in the main setStyle function.
    - all the markers should be in the markerLayer at all times
    - change in: legend checkbox onchange handler, legend archive button, info window toggle archived button
        - the info window toggle archived button shouldn't do any setProperty stuff; that should be in onChildChanged
    - how to handle new points though? (what values for these properties?)
        - archived_visible = global archived_visible var
        - my_category_visible = true, even if not really. Good for people to get confirmation their point was added
- Set (and test) database rules:
    - New "archived" attribute for all data points, this is the only thing updateable
    - No deletion allowed
- Icons centered ever so slightly higher than their actual location
- Better colors for points
- Add comment feature on client
    - is the 'markers' variable necessary? Probably convenient for this but not sure otherwise
    - add database rule to allow appends to comments array
- Comments can be "deleted" - just means they will no longer show, database still has it
- Styling archived points differently? Could do easily in the setStyle function where we style the other points
- Allow backup creation client side
- Add widget to change the map's center (Camp Raven Knob, Duke, etc.)
- Fix autopan margin since it's now dropdown menus. Note that the menus can change height if the text is long enough
- Set category to "Other" in existing data for points missing this attribute
