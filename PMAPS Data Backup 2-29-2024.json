When we did the route this year, the path we took looked nothing like the map and spat us out on the road in a v different location from where we wanted to be. Just take that road all the way East.

You'll have to park at this intersection.\n\nSo basically for the fun run, take the Cove Creek Trail north to 225, turn Right, follow 225 (which won't be marked) to 475B, go down 475B, turn right on the paved road, *make sure that the babies run in the left lane against traffic because #safety, and then turn right up into Cove.
