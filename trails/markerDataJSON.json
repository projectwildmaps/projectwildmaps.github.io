This trail is rarely taken and somehow seems more 'primordial' than the others. You'll be laying in a little pool of water on the top of the falls and staring up into the towering greenth and you'll feel like you did on your first trip - like there's no civilization for twenty miles in every direction.\n\nAlso, we found a crayfish in the top of the falls here, which really makes me wonder. How could it have survived there? These streams filter down from the edge of the BRP. It and its brethren must have been in these hills for thousands or millions of years.\n\nNote that this trail is especially tedious to reach from the road, so don't try anything silly.",

You *will* get to a road (Road 225) if you never decide to take a trail South. When we did the route this year, the path we took looked nothing like the map and spat us out on the road in a v different location from where we wanted to be. Just take that road all the way East. NEVER. TURN. LEFT. \n\nAlso, DO NOT EXPECT TO DRIVE DOWN 225! This is how runners got lost in 2014. You can drive up 475B, but 225 is CLOSED. You'll have to park at this intersection.\n\nSo basically for the fun run, take the Cove Creek Trail north to 225, turn Right, follow 225 (which won't be marked) to 475B, go down 475B, turn right on the paved road, *make sure that the babies run in the left lane against traffic because #safety, and then turn right up into Cove. This year (2015) the route was 9.5 miles because the route to get from Cove to 225 was pretty long.\n\nAlso watch out for misogynist bear killing hunters that may heckle girls.",

If you make it to some campsites called YG, that means yellow gap (too far). It is NOT through a campsite. Using parking lots to tell distance is ineffective (what even IS a parking lot in pisgah).
